In this light, we, along with our government, also need to maintain a level of diligence towards the development efforts happening in our country.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to make this platform more collaborative in the future. I hope you find it useful.\r\n\r\nThe source code is publicly available at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/poudel/gm).",
